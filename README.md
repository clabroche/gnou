# Gnou

Small functional project coded in a few hours and requiring a little refactoring.

This game is based on the real game
[COMMENT J'AI ADOPTÃ‰ UN GNOU]([https://link](https://ledroitdeperdre.com/nos-jeux/18-comment-j-ai-adopte-un-gnou.html)).

It's better to have the real game, but with this website you can play it anywhere and anytime. 

Only in french.
